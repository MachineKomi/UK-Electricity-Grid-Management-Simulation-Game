# UK Electricity Grid Management Simulation Game

## Overview

The **UK Electricity Grid Management Simulation Game** is an interactive web-based game where players take control of the UK's electricity grid. Your role is to balance electricity generation and demand, adjust to changing weather conditions, and make critical decisions to keep the grid stable for as long as possible.

This project simulates real-life grid management challenges in an easy-to-understand way, incorporating grid events, weather conditions, and unpredictable fluctuations in both demand and generation.

## Features

- **Control Panel**: Manage electricity generation and observe changes in demand.
- **Grid Event Log**: Track all the events impacting grid stability.
- **Dynamic Weather Conditions**: Different weather events affect generation and demand, requiring adaptive management.
- **Stability Ticker**: Track how long the grid remains stable and beat your high score.
- **Blackout Countdown**: The countdown starts if the grid becomes unbalanced, making it crucial to stabilize the grid before the countdown ends.

## How to Play

1. **Control the Grid**: Use the sliders in the control panel to adjust the total generation and demand.
2. **Weather Adaptation**: Monitor weather conditions and make changes accordingly, as these can significantly impact the grid.
3. **Prevent Blackouts**: Maintain the balance between electricity generation and demand to keep the grid stable.
4. **Beat the High Score**: Keep the grid stable for as long as possible and track your stability time against the high score.
